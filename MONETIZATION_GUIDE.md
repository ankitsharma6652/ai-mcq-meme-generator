## 2. 📢 Google AdSense (Display Ads)
Good for passive income if you have **high traffic** (1000+ visitors/day).

### **Pros**
*   Set it and forget it.
*   Reliable payments from Google.

### **Cons**
*   **Approval Difficulty:** Google often rejects "Single Page Applications" (tools) for "Low Value Content". You need lots of text (like your Tutorial page) to get approved.
*   **UX Impact:** Ads can make the app look "cheap" or slow it down.

### **Strategy**
*   Place ads **only** on the **Community Feed**, **Leaderboard**, and **Tutorial** pages.
*   Keep the main **Generator Tool** clean to ensure users have a good experience.

## 3. ☕ Donations / Tipping
The easiest way to start monetizing immediately without complex code.

*   **Platform:** [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/).
*   **Placement:** Add a floating button or a link in the header/footer.
*   **Incentive:** "Support server costs and keep the AI free!"

## 4. 🤝 Affiliate Marketing
Recommend related tools to your student/learner audience.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "Prepare for your exams with [Coursera/Udemy]" (Affiliate links)
    *   "Host your own app on [Render]"
*   **Placement:** Add a "Resources" or "Recommended Tools" section.

## 5. 🏢 B2B API (Advanced)
If your meme/quiz generation is really good, other developers might want to use it.
*   Sell access to your **API**.
*   Charge per 1,000 requests.

4.  **Phase 4 (Freemium):** If users are hitting the rate limits often, introduce a Pro plan to remove limits.
